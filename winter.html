    <h6>FEDYA.</h6> 
    <p>The chief thing about a town is that it should be clean. If it's
    dusty, it must be watered; if it's dirty, it must be cleaned. There
    ought to be big houses... a theatre... police... cabs, which... I've
    lived in a town myself, I understand.</p>
    
    <h6>BORTSOV.</h6> 
    <p>Just a little glass. I'll pay you for it later.</p>

    <h6>TIHON.</h6>
