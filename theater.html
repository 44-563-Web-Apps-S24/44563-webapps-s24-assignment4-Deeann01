    <h1>Deepika Annapureddy Does Chekov Tonight</h1>
    <h3>On the High Road-Anton Chekov</h3>
    <h6>FEDYA.</h6> 
    <p>You ought to drink a little vodka, grandfather. Drink, and it'll
    burn, burn in your stomach, and warm up your heart. Drink, do!</p>
    
    <h6>NAZAROVNA.</h6>
    <p>Don't swank, young man! Perhaps the old man is giving back
    his soul to God, or repenting for his sins, and you talk like that, and
    play your concertina.... Put it down! You've no shame!</p>

    <h6>FEDYA.</h6> 
    <p>And what are you sticking to him for? He can't do anything and
    you... with your old women's talk... He can't say a word in reply, and
    you're glad, and happy because he's listening to your nonsense.... You
    go on sleeping, grandfather; never mind her! Let her talk, don't you
    take any notice of her. A woman's tongue is the devil's broom--it will
    sweep the good man and the clever man both out of the house. Don't
    you mind.... 
    <p>[Waves his hands]</p>
    <p> But it's thin you are, brother of mine!
    Terrible! Like a dead skeleton! No life in you! Are you really dying?</p>

    <h6>SAVVA.</h6> 
    <p>Why should I die? Save me, O Lord, from dying in vain.... I'll
    suffer a little, and then get up with God's help.... The Mother of God
    won't let me die in a strange land.... I'll die at home.</p>

    <h6>FEDYA.</h6>
    <p> Are you from far off?</p>

    <h6>SAVVA.</h6> 
    <p> From Vologda. The town itself.... I live there.</p>

    <h6>FEDYA.</h6> 
    <p>And where is this Vologda?</p>

    <h6>TIHON.</h6>  
    <p>The other side of Moscow....</p>

    <h6>FEDYA.</h6>  
    <p>Well, well, well.... You have come a long way, old man! On foot?</p>

    <h6>SAVVA.</h6>
    <p>On foot, young man. I've been to Tihon of the Don, and I'm going to the Holy Hills.</p>
    <p>[Note: On the Donetz, south-east of Kharkov; a monastery containing a miraculous ikon.]... </p>
    <p>From there, if God wills it, to Odessa.... They say you can get to Jerusalem cheap from there, for twenty-ones roubles, they say....</p>
    
    <h6>FEDYA.</h6>
    <p>And have you been to Moscow?</p>
    
    <h6>SAVVA.</h6>
    <p>Rather! Five times....</p>
    
    <h6>FEDYA.</h6>
    <p>Is it a good town?</p>
    <p> [Smokes]</p>
    <p> Well-standing?</p>
    
    <p>Savva sews. There are many holy places there, young man.... Where there are many holy places it's always a good town....</p>
    
    <h6>BORTSOV.</h6>
    <p>Goes up to the counter, to Tihon.
    <p>Once more, please!For the sake of Christ, give it to me!</p>
